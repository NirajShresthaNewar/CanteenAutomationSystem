Recipe Creation Flow:

Create recipes in the recipes table
Add ingredients with quantities in recipe_ingredients
Link recipes to menu items in the menu_items table
Calculate and store costs in recipe_costs


Production Flow:
Record production in production_batches
Automatically deduct ingredients from inventory in production_inventory_deductions
Update inventory quantities in your inventory table


Order Flow:
Customer places order in orders and order_items
System deducts ingredients from inventory based on recipes in order_inventory_deductions
Updates inventory quantities in your inventory table


Production Inventory Deductions Table

Tracks ingredients used when preparing food in advance (batch cooking)
Records deductions when you make 50 sandwiches, 20 portions of curry, etc.
These deductions happen before any customer orders

Order Inventory Deductions Table

Tracks ingredients used for made-to-order items
Records deductions when a customer places an order for something prepared fresh
These deductions happen at the time of customer order

this is the general idea so save this requirement  and after reviewing it in files and work according to this
